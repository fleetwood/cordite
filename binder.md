##### tabletop role-playing game system by madeleine & friends

</div>

### Core System

Cordite originated as a fork of 5th Edition DnD (and some inspiration from other systems), and while it has long since deviated enough to be considered its own system, its lineage is evident. This would not exist without WotC's base platform providing the shoulders for me, and so many others, to stand on. nor without the help of many people in my life, primarily my wonderful beans, who have accompanied me every single step of the way. I love you so much beans. <3

#### Health

Hit points are called Will in my system. Taking damage is not just physical injury; it is *primarily* your *will* to fight eroding through the stress of combat.

#### **Stats**

My system uses a similar stat system to 5e DnD, with some alterations; the stats are **Physique, Finesse, Wit, Intuition, Fortitude,** and **Charisma.**

Stats scale very simply: 0 is a +0 modifier, and your modifier for a stat is simply its integer value; if your Fortitude stat is 2, then your FOR modifier is +2. Conversely, if it is -2, then its modifier is -2.

The caps (outside of prestige levels) for players stats are +5, and cannot go below -2. You cannot raise a stat to +5 until level 5, and you cannot raise a second stat to +5 until level 9.





**Physique**

Your physique (PHY) is how fit and physically able your body is to perform challenging feats of strength and mobility. 



**Finesse**

Finesse (FIN) is your ability to perform quick, smooth, or precise actions, typically without being noticed. 



**Wit**

Wit (WIT) represents how sharp your mind is; how quickly you can gather information, and assess and react to a situation. Think of it like dexterity for your brain.



**Intuition**

Intuition (INT) represents your recollection skills and ability to make inferences; how well you can call on things you've learned, and draw conclusions from your environment or someone's behavior.



**Fortitude**

Fortitude (FOR) is both your resistance to physical punishment **and** mental punishment, from being shot to not panicking that you were just shot.



**Charisma**

Charisma (CHA) is your ability to impose your will upon the world through non-physical means.





#### **Casting Stats**

Also included are specific stats for casting. My system and setting has its own magic system, which is channeling the elements that life energy is composed of: earth, fire, water, air, life, light, and spacetime. Each element has its own corresponding stat, which scales from 0 upward, and your modifier for that element is determined like any other stat mod.

Your stat for an element determines not just your modifier for that element, but also your capability to channel that element at all; a stat of 0 means you cannot cast that element, whereas a stat of 5 means your abilities are some of the greatest on the planet. 

A level 1 character cannot have a casting stat higher than 1. Tentatively, you cannot have more than two casting stats greater than 0. Casting stats may only be increased every odd level. Casting will be covered in much greater detail later.




**In summary, the stats are: Physique, Finesse, Fortitude, Wit, Intuition, Charisma | Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Life, Light, Spacetime**

#### **Levels**

There are 9 base levels, with an additional 4 prestige levels, totaling to 13 levels. The only way to level is milestone leveling.

Scaling in CORDITE was built with a few landmarks in mind. At level 5, a player will have the core mechanics and toolkit of their class available to use and feel like they are well equipped to take on a challenging quest for a competent party. A level 9 player is a master of their craft and a well-respected figure, and a sort of "1.5" version of what their class was at level 5 with enhanced features and functionality, but not a god-killing beast.

A long campaign does not necessarily have to end in a duel with godlike figures, but for those that do, prestige levels exist to allow that tier of play. Each prestige level is a significant power spike in its own right with powerful effects or abilities; think of level 13 (aka prestige 4) as the closest equivalent to 5e's level 20. Prestige level class features are strong, but designed to be more like bonuses on top of what a class already has; no class should feel incomplete without its prestige levels.

Most campaigns should set level 9 as a target for end-game content to be played at, excepting those with extreme challenges and power levels. Campaigns can spend some time at level 9, as the classes are designed to feel thorough and rewarding at this level. The skill tree system (mentioned shortly) can also be used to provide additional progression even after levelups are no longer a factor.






#### **Skills**

The specifics of each skill will be detailed later, under character creation. For now, here is a list detailing each skill and its parent stat. 



**Physique**

Acrobatics

Athletics



**Finesse** 

Driving

Sleight of Hand

Stealth



**Wit**

Investigation

Perception



**Intuition**

Empathy

Information Skills

Insight




**Charisma**

Deception

Intimidation

Performance

Persuasion



**Proficiency & Expertise**

Proficiency starts as a +1 modifier, and increases by 1 every even level. Expertise limits your minimum roll in that skill to a natural 8.


#### **Character Expression Trees**

Please see their specific document for further information: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-NeYMVqyAmP_4aWbV-tI



#### **RAD**

RAD is a fundamental mechanic of CORDITE, which includes maneuvers inspired by 5e, but is a larger concept in scope and application than just maneuvers, whose specific mechanics will be detailed later.



A **RAD** is when you attempt to do something particularly brilliant or challenging - specifically, a **R**adical **A**ction or **D**ecision; striking a foe and knocking them off their feet, a sudden burst of speed at the last second, a deliberate and wry comment to sway a political foe to your side, pulling on your investigative abilities to piece together an obscure clue, and so on. When making a RAD roll, you roll a RAD die and add it to the roll.

Mechanically, **RAD** exists to provide a way for a player to be rewarded for a particularly clever and in-character approach to a problem. RAD dice are all D8s, and your pool of RAD dice is determined by your stats. What distinguishes a RAD from a regular roll or action is the clever or creative nature in which it's executed; a player may be offered the choice to perform an action as a RAD after describing a creative approach to the action, or may request to perform a RAD and explain the details of their approach.



A RAD will often be an action that is intended to produce multiple effects, and as such may involve multiple rolls in response to it; the only roll that applies the RAD die is the action itself. When following the chain of events the RAD creates, keep in mind that the point of a RAD is not necessarily the bonus to the roll, but to reward a player for smart thinking and good roleplaying. The roll helps of course, but the grander point is to provide a system for which DMs can reward their players for their creativity.

 <center> 
 
 **RAD Save DC** = 8 + (2 x stat modifier from RAD roll)
 
  </center>
 




All RAD dice are d8s, and characters have infinite RAD dice. Your minimum RAD die roll is your stat modifier for the RAD.




#### **Rests**

**Long Rest**

A long rest is 8 or more hours of sound, uninterrupted sleep. Long rests restore all your resources; Will, hit dice, etc. 



**Short Rest**

A short rest is 2 hours of relaxing or resting. It does not necessarily have to be sleep, but players must legitimately be able to relax or rest in whatever situation they are currently in. Don't let players bullshit you on getting in their rests, they are deliberately provided plenty of resource to use in CORDITE. Short rests replenish half your hit dice rounded up.



**Moment's Rest**

A moment's rest (or a breather) is 20 minutes of pausing to catch your breath and regain your mental footing; 2 hit dice are restored in a moment's rest.








### Combat

*hey, don't worry if all of this doesn't immediately stick - the best way to learn is through playing!*

#### **Attack Rolls**

Attack rolls *only* apply your proficiency bonus to hit - you do not apply any other modifiers to rolls to hit, unless otherwise specified.

#### **Armor**

All classes have a base AC and DT value listed on their class page; "starter armor" is not present in my system. Armor items can still exist, but are much more special as +1 AC becomes significantly more important with the squished AC values.

The appearance of your character's armor and outfit is up to you to define as you please.

#### **Initiative**



All participants still roll at the start of combat, but you now roll a D8. Instead of adding your WIT mod, it is treated as a minimum roll. If your WIT mod is 4 but you roll a 1, treat your roll as a 4.

To break initiative ties, first compare WIT modifiers; highest goes first. If the WIT mods are also identical, then use FIN. If the roll, WIT mod, and FIN mod are the same, then perform one of two actions depending on if it's a tie between players or an NPC: if it's two players, have both players roll a d20 until one rolls higher than the other; highest roll goes first. If it's between a player and an NPC, the player auto-wins the tie.

#### **Rounds and Turns**

Combat is composed of **Rounds**, and rounds are broken up into **Turns**. In combat you have a defined amount of Action Points (AP), which you spend on your turn to perform actions - there is a **turn cap** on how much AP you can spend per turn.

At the start of a round, the person first in initiative order takes their turn. In a turn, you can spend a number of your AP on various actions up to your turn cap, after which your turn ends - you may also end your turn prematurely at any time. 

After a turn ends, the next turn in the initiative order begins. This process continues through turn order, going *back* to the top of turn order after the lowest initiative turn has been taken, and repeats until everyone has spent all their AP, or doesn't want to take another turn. At this point the round ends, and initiative order is recalculated.

Add your remaining AP, if any, to your WIT mod - this is your new initiative number, and turn order is redetermined on these new values, with ties broken in the same manner as before. 

After the new turn order is decided, the next round begins.






#### **Action Economy**

While you have a total of 16 AP, **you may spend no more than 6 AP per turn** - this is called your **Turn Cap (TC)**, and is reset at the start of your next turn. Because of this, AP spent in-between turns is counted against your current turn cap. All your AP is restored at the beginning of a round. 

***Actions***

All actions cost 3 AP, unless explicitly stated otherwise. There is no inherent limit to how many actions you may make per turn or round, but there are some exceptions.

***Hastened Actions***

A hastened action is when you perform an action for cheaper than it would normally cost. Hastened actions cost 1 AP, and you have 1 charge per round; if you haven't reached your turn cap at the start of your next turn, your hastened action charge is restored at the start of that turn. You may, alternatively, spend a RAD die to *immediately* restore your hastened action. Actions that cannot be performed as hastened actions are called **exclusive actions,** and you may perform no more than **one** hastened actions per turn.

***Attacks***

Attacking is defined as an attack action, and costs 5 AP. When you use the attack action, you make one attack.

***Opportunity Attacks***

Opportunity attacks are a separate resource from reactions, and used exclusively for making opportunity attacks. Restoring an opportunity attack costs 3 AP. You do not start a round with an opportunity attack, nor is it replenished at the start of subsequent rounds in combat; instead, you are granted a charge on your first turn in a round. 

***Reactions***

Reactions do not cost any AP, have 2 charges per round, and can also be restored before the start of a new round using 1 AP. You start combat with 2 reaction charges, and one is restored at the start of a new turn; both are restored at the start of a new round. Reactions do not take place until after a weapon's ROF burst has finished, even if they are in reaction to something in the middle of a burst. ROF is explained further in the document.

***Movement***

Your movement speed (also called free movement) defines how much movement you may make *per turn* with no point cost. You may perform certain actions to get movement beyond this limit, and reactions can be spent between turns on movement too; these details are explained later.

***AP Decay***

An AP decay is enforced; even if you spend less than 3 AP on your turn, you still lose 3 AP. This represents time passing in combat, and serves to preserve the flow of combat so that people who save all their AP don't go sicko mode for a bunch of turns in a row while everyone else is helpless.



#### **Light and Darkvision**

Because all the races in my setting have native darkvision, lighting is handled differently than others. 



Mechanically, there is only full light or darkness. You may see up to 50ft. into darkness *(this "visible distance" is known as low light, but seeing in darkness is the only time players ever have to interact with low light)*; any checks using sight or ranged attacks made on something in low light are done with disadvantage. Anything past a visible distance in darkness cannot be interacted with using sight.

#### **Damage and Glancing Blows**

When dealing damage with any weapon (unless otherwise specified), you may choose to apply your physique *or* finesse mod.

CORDITE's combat has very high lethality, which presents some issues when using a simple pass/fail determinant for dealing damage, as one miss can mean an enemy is still on their feet, who will do a LOT of damage back to you. Thus, my system uses 2 determinant values for calculating a hit: Armor Class (AC) and Damage Threshold (DT). 

If your roll ties or beats the target's AC, you roll your attack's damage dice and add your attacking stat's modifier. If an attack roll ties or beats a creature's DT value but NOT their AC, you may still roll damage; however, the damage dealt is halved, rounded down. Dealing damage in this manner is called a **glancing blow**. 

If a player would have their Will reduced from max (or perhaps close) to 0 or less, you can instead reduce their Will to 1. Getting instakilled sucks, and it's better to have an emergency stop in the system to prevent it. (this may or may not also apply to important bosses and NPCs ;3)



#### **Death Throes & Executions**

If your HP is reduced to 0, you enter your death throes, in which you are considered prone, and cannot move or perform any actions - if your HP is returned to at least 1 (for example by an ally healing you), you return to consciousness. 

While in your death throes, you have a second HP value, equal to your current maximum Will, called your Death HP. Taking damage while in your death throes deducts from this value; when it reaches 0, you die, regardless of your successes on your rolls. Any damage in excess of what reduced you to 0 Will rolls over as "overkill" damage to be deducted from your death HP. Your death HP does not reset or replenish under any circumstance besides a long rest, upon which it is fully restored.

Each turn you start in your death throes, you roll a d20; a 16 or higher is a success. Upon reaching 3 successes, you are rendered unconscious and will awaken in 1 hour. For every failed death save, you deduct 1 from your DHP. You cannot be reduced below 1 DHP by failed death saves. An adjacent ally may spend an  **exclusive** action to stabilize your character, automatically succeeding on all 3 throes and instantly rendering you unconscious.


Enemies may attempt to execute players in their death throes. In addition to the usual modifiers of an attack on a prone player, attacks made adjacent to a character in their death throes are a guaranteed success. However, players may use their opportunity attacks on an enemy attempting to execute a player, without disadvantage (as the enemy is not moving, unlike a standard opportunity attack).

Enemies function by all of these rules as well, but their death saves work differently: on a success, they get back up with only half their remaining death HP as their hit points. They may attempt to get back up 3 times; after failing 3 attempts, or losing all their death HP (including through overkill damage), they are fully dead (or at least fully unconscious - DM discretion.)

The stronger an enemy is, the less they should have any death HP; an enemy with 0 death HP will have no way to get back up. Death HP should be a small value; no greater than half an enemy's max HP. These rules can be bent for certain enemy types e.g. undead.



#### **Melee Weapons**

Melee weapons receive their stats from a simple table of damage dice and damage types, listed later in the document. Unique qualities such as Versatile and Thrown are handled on a per-weapon basis when relevant.

Attacking with a melee weapon against a creature who has only a ranged weapon drawn, and no shield or drawn melee weapon, grants advantage on the attack. Bayonets count as a drawn melee weapon.

Melee weapons may also choose 1 free tier 1 **PHY/FIN** maneuver that's tied to the weapon. You can't get an extra maneuver from dual wielding in this manner.



#### **Taking Cover**

To take cover, you must be adjacent to a valid piece of cover and state clearly that you are taking cover - your DM will determine what counts as effective cover. When a shot is intercepted by cover, add 2 to the target's armor values. Attacks intercepted by cover cannot do more than a glancing blow. 

You may also take cover using the corner of a wall; this has no affect on AC, because nothing is intercepting a projectile from an enemy that can actually see you. When attacking from corner cover, you may duck around the corner and draw line of sight from the edge instead.



#### **Opportunity Attacks**

When a creature moves while within your weapon's lower range value you may make an opportunity attack against it with disadvantage; shotguns can only make one so long as their attack would still roll damage dice. 

Melee opportunity attacks are made with disadvantage by default, but this is neutralized by the advantage granted from attacking an enemy who has no melee weapon drawn. 

Players may also use their opportunity attacks on an enemy attempting to execute a player, without disadvantage (as the enemy is not moving, unlike a standard opportunity attack).

Opportunity attacks cannot be made with ranged weapons while taking cover *if the cover would intercept your ability to take the shot*. A ranged opportunity attack cannot be made by a player or NPC until they take their first turn after rolling for initiative; this takes effect any time initiative is rolled.



#### **Return Fire**

When an enemy misses you with a blindfire attack, you may use your reaction to make an attack against them, provided there are no conditions which would prevent you from making this attack (bound, paralyzed, out of range, etc.) These attacks are made with disadvantage, and do not apply a stat modifier to damage.



#### **Dual Wielding**

You can dual wield any combination of one-handed weapons. Dual wielding on its own does not grant any extra attacks.





#### **Disciplines**

Disciplines are a particular way of fighting that someone has trained to become adept at. All characters choose a discipline at level 1. You may choose to change this discipline retroactively, with appropriate in-character coordination with your DM. Warriors may pick an additional discipline at level 5. Rangers pick 2 disciplines on character creation, and may change between them using their core mechanic.

A list of available disciplines is provided later, under character creation.




#### **Weapon Size and Drawing Weapons**

Large weapons are difficult to maneuver in the heat of combat in tight spaces. Weapons marked as **long** have disadvantage attacking targets at 10ft. or closer.

Shorter weapons aren't concealable or comfortable within point blank range, but don't suffer inside small rooms or hallways like larger firearms do. Weapons marked as **short** have disadvantage attacking targets at 5ft. or closer.

Smaller weapons, such as pistols, are much more useful up close and in confined spaces - weapons like this are marked as **compact**, and do not suffer close range disadvantage.

Drawing a weapon costs an action; drawing a two-handed weapon is an exclusive action.


#### **RADs - Maneuvers**

Maneuvers, as mentioned before, fall under the RAD umbrella. When making an attack, you can execute a maneuver to augment that attack. However, maneuvers are not strictly coupled with attacks. You may perform no more than 1 maneuver per turn. Maneuvers are primarily provided through CEXP Trees.





### Firearms: Properties & Mechanics


#### **Skilled and Complex Weapons**

**Skilled**

Like martial and simple melee weapons, firearms are divided into **skilled** and **unskilled**. All players start as unskilled with firearms, and can become skilled by acquiring the skill through the PHY+FIN skill tree.  However, someone who is unskilled with firearms can still equip and fire skilled firearms, albeit with limited effectiveness.

When firing a skilled firearm without proficiency, you may not add your proficiency modifier to attack rolls.



**Complex**

Prototype or bleeding-edge technology is often unreliable and finicky, but can provide extreme firepower increases; firearms of this type have the *complex* quality. When firing a complex weapon without the appropriate skill,  you must make a malfunction check whenever you roll a natural 5 or lower, *guarantee* a malfunction on a 1, and do not add your proficiency modifier to its attack rolls.



**Prone**

If your player is *skilled* with firearms, you have advantage on ranged attacks made with a firearm from prone.

#### **Single-Loading Weapons**

Weapons that must have rounds loaded one at a time, such as double-barrel shotguns, tube fed guns, or revolvers (without speedloaders), are defined as single-loading weapons. Reloading 1 round into these guns costs **1 AP.**


#### **Packet Loading Systems**

Weapons with some means of reloading more than a single round at a time are considered packet loaders; detachable box magazines, stripper clips, or en bloc/mannlicher clips are all examples of packet loading. Reloading a packet of ammo into your weapon costs **5 AP**, or if a gun allows it, you may use a described amount of AP per round to reload. You may use a hastened action to make a packet reload cost **3 AP.**



#### **Shotguns and Spread Munitions**

Instead of standard range values, shotguns instead have a damage dropoff interval where for each specified increment of distance from the shooter, the gun rolls less damage dice. A shotgun with range intervals of -2d4/15ft loses 2d4 from its damage rolls every 15 feet of distance the target is from the shooter until it eventually rolls no damage dice, after which the enemy is considered out of range and may not be attacked.



#### **Repeating Firearms**

Firearms or other weapons that can cycle rapidly may sometimes attack more than once when you take the attack action. To understand how this system works, treat your attack action as a "burst." Each firearm will specify how many times it can fire per burst (ROF, or Rate Of Fire), and the penalties for multiple consecutive shots with it. ROF in this case is sort of a modifier on the maximum number of attacks when you take the attack action; consecutive shot penalties begin to be applied after firing more than once in a single bursts (up to two times), and reset when moving to the next burst.

For example, you are a 5th level warrior with 2 attacks per turn, and you have a gun with an ROF of 4 and a shot penalty of -2. For your first "burst" you may fire the gun once as normal, and fire a second time with a -2 penalty to hit, fire a *third* time with a -4 penalty, and a ***fourth*** time, still with a -4 penalty. Changing targets during a burst doubles ROF penalty. This modifier then resets when you move into your second "burst" for that turn. 

This system represents follow-up shots fired under recoil and the reset time in between them. For balance reasons, it exists to mitigate the power of a multiplier on your attacks per turn.

If you aren't *skilled* with firearms, you do not apply proficiency to attack rolls with ROF attacks, even if the weapon otherwise doesn't require you to be skilled.




#### **Weapon Malfunctions**

If one of the following happens, you malfunction the firearm and must make a skill check:

1: Roll a natural 1 on an attack with a firearm.

2: Roll a natural 5 or lower on an attack with a complex firearm without meeting its requirements. If you roll a natural 1, you *guarantee* the malfunction, and go straight to needing to attempt repairs.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
 
 <font size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Skill Save DC** </font> = <font size='2'> 20 - your arms (ballistic) skill modifier + your FOR mod </font>
 
 </center>
 
 



If you fail the skill check, your gun malfunctions and you must attempt to fix it. You may spend an action to roll to fix the malfunction; for each failed attempt to fix that malfunction, you gain a stacking +1 bonus to your checks to clear *that* malfunction, meaning the bonus resets once it's fixed.


#### **Gun Butt**

As an **exclusive action** when you have a ranged weapon drawn, you may strike an enemy adjacent to you with the butt of your gun, making all their movement until the start of your next turn cost 1 AP per 5ft. When moving under the effects of gun butt, free movement cannot be used.





### Firearms: Other Properties

#### **Extra Barrels**

Some firearms have multiple barrels, and some can fire multiple barrels simultaneously. If a weapon has this capability, and more than one barrel is loaded, you may fire every loaded barrel on your weapon simultaneously, applying all damage as if it were a single attack. Unless you are skilled with firearms you impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### **Stopping Power / Precise**

Some firearms chamber particularly potent cartridges, making them pierce armor more easily and deal immense damage on impact; some are particularly finely made and accurate, allowing you to more easily make lethal hits. These weapons are given the *stopping power* or *precise* traits, respectively, and have a +2 to their attack rolls.

#### **Bayonets**

Sometimes a gun may have a blade affixed to the end of its barrel, or some other means of providing it a melee presence in combat. Weapons with the bayonet characteristic may replace an attack with a single melee attack once per turn, the stats of which will be defined on the weapon's card itself. Players who are proficient with martial weapons can use their normal amount of attack actions with their bayonet. The number of bayonet attacks you can make per attack action is unaffected by the gun's ROF stat.

#### **Optical sights**

**Low-power optics**

Optical sights with little or no magnification on them are the simplest to use, and are designed around faster target acquisition than iron sights, with a cleaner sight picture and typically a very simple targeting reticle. In settings that predate powered optics, consider changing this to precision/match irons, instead. 

When you have a weapon with a low-power optic drawn, you may take the **Steady Aim** action.



**Steady Aim**

Your finer sights allow you to make precisely aimed shots even in the heat of combat. You may end any further movement for your current turn to grant advantage on the next shot you fire with this weapon on that turn.



**Precision optics**

Players may only benefit from precision optics if they are *skilled* with firearms. Weapons with precision optics attack with advantage when firing from prone, and consume no movement when using the **Steady Aim** action.



#### **Suppressors**

If a gun is equipped with a suppressor, its gunshots are audible only to 50 feet away, although some guns may have different stats on their suppressor if it is flavored as damaged, or perhaps magically enhanced to absorb all sound of firing.




#### **Bipods**

Weapon emplacements absorb recoil, allowing accurate rapid fire. As an action, you may choose to mount your bipod on either the ground, or if your DM allows, other surfaces such as short walls and ledges. Mounting your bipod on the ground forces you to drop to prone. Dismounting your bipod is also an action.

While your bipod is mounted, you may take the **Steady Aim**  action granted by optics even if your gun does not have optical sights. Firing from a bipod does not impose disadvantage when prone, and halves the weapon's shot penalty, rounded down, to a minimum of -1. 


#### **Rifle Grenades**

 Firing a rifle grenade replaces your attack action, and this grenade cannot benefit from advantage from the **Steady Aim** action. You cannot fire a rifle grenade if you are not skilled with firearms. Well, you can try, but your DM is free to impose whatever consequences and modifiers they wish on it - get creative. c:
 
 
#### **Unwieldy**

Particularly heavy or bulky firearms can be difficult to move and shoot with rapidly; these weapons are marked as *unwieldy*. When you have an unwieldy weapon drawn, you may not take the dash action through any non-magical means. Dash actions granted by your class or subclass are excepted.


#### **Slow Reload**

Some weapons have reloading methods that are rather slower than others, and have the mechanics of their reloads changed accordingly:



**Packet Loading**

Packet loading firearms with slow reloads may not conduct any movement on the turn they reload, nor may they reload with a hastened action.



**Single Loading**

Loading one round into a single loading weapon with a slow reload costs **2 AP** per round, instead of 1.

#### **Quick Reload**

Conversely, some weapons are much quicker to reload, and have different reload mechanics:



**Packet Loading**

Packet loading firearms with quick reloads may reload as an **exclusive action.**








### Action Economy Quick Guide



Actions, unless specified otherwise, have no limit per round/turn. Baseline, you have only 1 hastened action and 2 reactions per round, which are all restored at the start of the next round. 

Opportunity attacks are a separate resource from reactions, and you do not start combat or any round with one - instead, you are granted one on your first turn in a round of combat. You only have 1 opportunity attack charge.

Hastened actions, reactions, and opportunity attacks may be restored before the start of the next round by various methods.



**AP per round:** 16



**Turn Cap:** 6



**Action AP cost:** 3



**Attack Action AP cost:** 5



**Bonus Action AP cost:** 1

**Restore Bonus Action cost:** restored if you haven't reached your turn cap at the start of your next turn. Alternatively, may spend one RAD die to instantly restore a hastened action



**Opportunity attack AP cost:** 0

**Restore opportunity attack AP cost:** 3



**Reaction AP cost:** 0

**Restore Reaction AP cost:** 1

1 reaction is restored at the start of a turn.




Your movement speed defines how much free movement you get per TURN. To make additional movement on your turns, you must use dash actions or maneuvers.

Between turns, you may use a reaction to spend 1 AP (this is not deducted from any turn cap), first to spend any remaining free movement, and then an additional 10ft.



**Reloading:** Reloading a single loading weapon costs 1 AP per round loaded. Reloading a packet loading weapon is an action.



**Maneuvers** can be executed in combat, and only 1 maneuver may be performed per turn.



A per-turn minimum **AP decay** of 3 AP is enforced; even if you spend less than 3 AP on a turn, you still lose 3 AP for that turn.



### Turn Guide

Listed below are the options available to **all** creatures during combat, unless they are specifically excluded from one. Actions can be made as a hastened action, unless it is an **exclusive action,** or has a prescribed AP cost. 

Your class, subclass, weapon, and other sources may provide you additional options, the details of which will be listed in alongside them.

#### Actions



##### **Attack**

For 5 AP, make an attack on an enemy within range of the weapon you're attacking with. Roll a d20 and add your proficiency modifier; if you break their DT or AC values, roll the damage dice listed on your weapon and add the modifier of the stat you've chosen for attacking. If you only broke DT, you deal half that damage, rounded down. 

If your weapon has a rate of fire stat above 1, as part of that attack action, you may make an additional number of attacks up or equal to that number; successive attacks made with rate of fire apply your ROF penalty, stacking each time you attack. Changing targets mid-burst doubles the ROF penalty increase applied for that attack.



##### **Blindfire**

Blindfire is an alternate attack action that costs the same as a regular action (and can be hastened), with some unique benefits and limitations: you cannot apply your proficiency modifier to the attack roll, you cannot break more than DT unless you crit, but you can shoot at enemies you can't see; if you can't see the enemy, you roll with disadvantage, and must make a perception check to know if you hit. Blindfire attacks do NOT count against your attack action limit per round.

Shotguns cannot fire at enemies you can't see, and you can't use maneuvers as part of a blindfire attack. You CAN use ROF while blindfiring.



##### **Cast**

You may channel any elements you have the ability to cast. AP cost is determined by what you cast, and is determined by the DM in response.



##### **Clear Malfunction**

As an action when your weapon is malfunctioning, you may give yourself advantage on the next roll to clear it.



##### **Dash**

As an action, you can move up to 20ft, taking opportunity attacks as normal. Movement made while dashing must all be made at once, ending if it's interrupted by any other action, reaction, etc. (unless specified otherwise).









### Turn Guide, cont.

##### **Disengage**

As an **exclusive action**, you can cease taking opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.



##### **Draw or Switch Weapons**

You can switch weapons on your turn in combat. Drawing a one-handed weapon is an action; drawing a two-handed weapon is an **exclusive action.**



##### **Grapple**

As an **exclusive action,** make a physique (athletics) check (DC = 10 +  2 x target's physique) to attempt a grapple on creature no more than one size larger than you who is adjacent to you; on a success, they become grappled. If they are one size larger than you, make the roll with disadvantage. If the enemy is at least one size smaller than you, make the roll with advantage, and you lose no movespeed while they're grappled. Refer to the details of the grappled state under the **status effect index** on page 14. 



##### **Heal**

As an action, you may spend and roll a hit die and heal for the roll of the die. (minimum roll = FOR mod) You can opt to spend and roll a RAD die as part of this heal, and add its roll to your heal as well.



##### **Interact with Environment**

You may suggest (and with DM's approval, execute) a way to interact with the environment on your turn. The AP cost depends on what you're attempting to do, and is determined by the DM in response. Shooting a piece of the environment, knocking something over, pulling a lever are all examples of valid options.



##### **Prone**

As an action, you may drop prone. Getting up from being prone is also an action. You may also use ALL your free movement to get up or go prone. 

While prone, attacks made from within 10ft. of you have advantage. If you are *skilled* with firearms you have advantage on attacks made with firearms while prone. You cannot grapple an enemy while prone. You cannot use free movement or dash while prone; instead, movement costs 1 AP/10ft. Going prone can interfere with line of sight, for example hiding behind a large box. Going prone can interfere with physique and finesse checks, depending on the check.





##### **Reload**

Reloading your weapon costs different amounts of AP depending on the weapon. 

If it's a single loading weapon, reloading 1 round into the weapon costs 1 AP; you may reload multiple rounds at a time. If it has the slow reload characteristic, it costs 2 AP per round loaded.

If it's a packet loading weapon, it costs 5 AP to reload the entire capacity, or 3 AP with a hastened action. If it has the slow reload characteristic, reloading your weapon prevents you from moving on that turn, and cannot decrease its cost with a hastened action. If it has the quick reload characteristic, reloading is an **exclusive action.**



##### **Return Fire**

When an enemy misses you with a blindfire attack, you may use your reaction to make an attack against them, provided there are no conditions which would prevent you from making this attack (bound, paralyzed, out of range, etc.) These attacks are made with disadvantage, and do not apply a stat modifier to damage.



##### **Take Cover**

For no AP cost, you may take cover; you must be adjacent to a valid piece of cover and state clearly that you are taking cover - your DM will determine what counts as effective cover. When a shot is intercepted by cover, add 2 to the target's armor values. Attacks intercepted by cover cannot do more than a glancing blow. Taking cover prevents you from making opportunity attacks anywhere where your vision would be impeded by your cover. If you make an attack that isn't a blindfire, you are exposed to opportunity attacks *after* the attack goes off.


#### RADs & Maneuvers

**RADs**

In combat, you may also attempt to perform RADs as you would outside of combat; however, they have an additional AP cost determined by your DM depending on what you're attempting to do.



**Maneuvers**

In combat you have a variety of specific bonuses you may add onto attacks, or as smaller things to do on your turn (or even as reactions), called maneuvers. You may spend a RAD die to perform a maneuver, or 1 AP. You can only spend 1 RAD die per turn, and you may make no more than 2 maneuvers per turn. For a list of available maneuvers, see page 17. 

You may have additional maneuvers given from other sources (such as your subclass or even your weapon), which will be explained where they are given.






### Turn Guide, cont.


#### Reactions & Opportunity Attacks



**Opportunity Attack**

At the start of your first turn in a round of combat, you are given an opportunity attack charge. If an enemy moves within the lesser range value of a weapon you have drawn, you may use that charge to attack them. This attack is made with disadvantage. For 3 AP, you can restore your opportunity attack charge ahead of your first turn in the next round.



**Scramble**

Between turns, you may use a reaction to spend 1 AP (this is not deducted from any turn cap), first to spend any remaining free movement, and then an additional 10ft.



**Interact with Environment**

Very quick interactions with the space around you may be performed as a reaction; this can be comboed into a Scramble reaction, if you are already scrambling. DM discretion as to what constitutes a "quick" interaction.



### Status Effect Index

Listed here are the various statuses creatures can experience and the effects and interactions thereof.



**Grappling and Grappled**

While **grappling** a creature, you have disadvantage on any checks related to using your body, and your movement per AP is halved, rounded to the nearest 5. You may swap weapons and attack with one-handed weapons; while you have an enemy grappled, if you would make an attack roll that has disadvantage, consider that attack impossible, after considering all factors that would apply or negate disadvantage. Attacks you make on the creature you have grappled have advantage.

If the enemy you're grappling is of a size that affects your movement speed, you are considered to be taking cover. You can choose to have attacks that don't break your AC hit the enemy you have grappled instead. If you take ten points or more of damage total while you have an enemy grappled, the grapple breaks. If the creature dies while grappled, you can choose to continue the grapple and use them as cover.

While **grappled**, you can't do things that involve moving your body, but you can still cast spells that do not require significant movement, or attempt to break the grapple; make a physique (athletics) or finesse (athletics) check to escape. (DC = 8 + grappler's athletics modifier (physique or athletics) + their FOR mod) Attacks made on you by the creature grappling you have advantage.






**Prone**

While prone, attacks made from within 10ft. of you have advantage. If you are *skilled* with firearms you have advantage on attacks made with firearms while prone. You cannot grapple an enemy while prone. Movement costs 1AP/5ft while prone, and you cannot use free movement. Going prone can interfere with line of sight, for example hiding behind a large box. Going prone can interfere with physique and finesse checks, depending on the check.



**Stunned**

While stunned you can't move, attack, or speak, and you automatically fail any checks. You can't perform any actions, reactions, hastened actions etc.



**Dazed**

While dazed you have disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls, you have no free movement, and movement costs 1 AP/5ft.




**Unconscious**

While unconscious, you are prone, unless specified otherwise. In addition to this, your passive perception is zero, you automatically fail any skill checks other than Fortitude saves. You cannot move, attack, or take any actions. Provided nothing is keeping you unconscious, an ally adjacent to you can spend an action to wake you up. You are completely unaware of your surroundings and what's happening around you. Being unconscious is different from sleeping.



### Character Creation

#### Soul & Purpose

What differentiates living things from inanimate objects is their souls; all living things have souls. A soul is the conduit that energy flows through to give things life. When a living thing is fiercely driven by a greater purpose, their soul conduit becomes more energetic and efficient, drawing more power through their soul in order to fulfill their greater purpose. 

Players must define a character's greater purpose as part of the character creation process. While this additional strength doesn't make you a superhero, it makes you a little bit smarter, a little bit faster, and a little more steadfast than your average person; your drive to achieve this goal is what makes you exceptional.

When a creature finds a greater purpose, their soul snaps, entering this energized state. This process can alter the nature of a soul conduit, granting the ability to channel energies that they hadn't before, causing somebody who was not born as a caster to become one later in life. 

There's no term for this in-setting, as it's not an understood or identified phenomenon; this serves as an explanation to you, the player, for why some people are a little more exceptional.

#### **Levels**

There are 9 base levels, with an additional 4 prestige levels, totaling to 13 levels. Leveling is exclusively through milestones.
Most campaigns should set level 9 as a target for end-game content to be played at, excepting those with extreme challenges and power levels. Campaigns can spend some time at level 9, as the classes are designed to feel thorough and rewarding at this level. 


#### Generating your Stats


CORDITE uses a unique system for generating stats; your stats on character creation must have a sum of 5. You cannot lower a stat below -2, and you cannot start with a stat above +3. Casting stats count for double, and you cannot have access to more than 2 elements.




1 stat point is awarded at every level above 1. At even levels, you gain an additional stat point; you can only increase casting stats at even levels. 



#### **Stats**

Stat scaling is as follows: 0 is a +0 modifier, and your modifier for a stat is simply its integer value; if your Fortitude stat is 2, then your FOR modifier is +2. Conversely, if it is -2, then its modifier is -2.

The caps (outside of prestige levels) for players stats are +5, and cannot go below -2. You cannot raise a stat to +5 until level 5, and you cannot raise a second stat to +5 until level 9.


**Physique**

Your physique (PHY) is how fit and physically able your body is to perform challenging feats of strength and mobility. 



**Finesse**

Finesse (FIN) is your ability to perform quick, smooth, or precise actions, typically without being noticed. 



**Fortitude**

Fortitude (FOR) is how well you can endure physical and mental punishment, whether it's being shot or keeping cool because you just got shot.




**Intuition**

Intuition (INT) represents your recollection skills and ability to make inferences; how well you can call on things you've learned, and draw conclusions from your environment or someone's behavior.



**Wit**

Wit (WIT) represents how sharp your mind is; how quickly you can gather information, and assess and react to a situation. Think of it like dexterity for your brain.




**Charisma**

Your Charisma (CHA) reflects your ability to impose your will upon others through non-violent means.





#### **Casting Stats**

CORDITE and its setting has its own magic system, which is channeling the elements that life energy is composed of: **earth, fire, water, air, life, light,** and **spacetime.** Each element has its own corresponding stat, which scales from 0 upward. Your modifier for that element is determined like any other stat mod.

Your stat for an element determines not just your modifier for that element, but also your capability to channel that element at all; a stat of 0 means you cannot cast that element, whereas a stat of 5 means your abilities are some of the greatest on the planet. 

A level 1 character cannot have a casting stat higher than 1. Tentatively, you cannot have more than two casting stats greater than 0. Casting stats may only be increased every odd level.




**In summary, the stats are: Physique, Finesse, Fortitude, Intuition, Wit, Charisma | Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Life, Light, Spacetime**







#### Will & Hit Dice

Your base Will is 10 + a max roll of your hit die + your FOR modifier. Each level above 1, you increase your Will by half your hit die. At levels 5 and 9, you *also* increase your Will by your FOR mod. Any time you increase your FOR, your modifier is applied retroactively to previous levels' Will increases.

All characters start with 4 hit dice, and gain an additional die at every level. When restoring Will with a hit die, your minimum roll on the die is your FOR mod.

A negative FOR mod has no affect on Will or hit die rolls.

#### **Skills**

On character creation, you may choose proficiency in 2 skills. Your subclass will provide you an additional 2 from a list specific to that subclass. Information skills by default use your Intuition modifier, but are counted separately from the other skills and will be explained later. 



**Why do some skills seem to overlap with others?**

This is intentional: a problem can often be solved in multiple different ways, and there are often multiple ways of reaching the same conclusion; your character will approach them in the ways they are most familiar with - their proficiencies!



##### **Physique**



**Acrobatics**

Acrobatics skill checks include things a performer or gymnast would do: flips, balancing on a tight rope, juggling, and so on.



**Athletics**

Athletics skill checks apply to actions of acute physical prowess or endurance; things an olympic athlete might do, like sprinting, swimming, grand leaps, scaling a cliff face, or wrestling a foe.
    


##### **Finesse** 



**Driving**

Driving is straightforward: how to effectively and quickly operate a motor vehicle.



**Sleight of Hand**

Sleight of hand skill checks apply to attempts to do sneaky or slick things with your hands, often with the condition of trying not to get caught. Cheating in a card game, pickpocketing someone, slipping a knife up your sleeve; these are a few examples of sleight of hand.



**Stealth**

Stealth skill checks simply refer to attempts to remain unseen, unheard, or otherwise undetected - excluding actions that would better fit sleight of hand.



##### **Wit**



**Investigation**

Investigation skill checks are when you are attempting to search for something, such as scanning a room for clues, inspecting a document for important information, or rifling through papers for anything conspicuous.



**Perception**

Perception checks are simply when you attempt to perceive something. Listening for movement, pressing against a wall to check for vibrations, trying to make out a blurry shape in the distance; these actions would be perception skill checks.





##### **Intuition**




**Empathy**

Empathy is your ability to intuit how somebody is feeling.



**Insight**

Insight is your ability to intuit what somebody is thinking. 



**What's the difference?**

*Insight* would tell you whether somebody is lying to you. *Empathy* would tell you if they're scared of the consequences of telling the truth, or if they're just trying to backstab you. 






##### **Charisma**

**Deception**

Deception is your ability to effectively mislead a person or critter through dishonesty.



**Intimidation**

Intimidation checks are made when attempting to scare someone or something, whether it's through shouting them down or a threatening gesture, such as twirling a brandished blade.



**Persuasion**

Persuasion is your ability to convince someone to think the way you want them to, without dishonesty or threats.



**Performance**

Performance is not just your effectiveness at playing an instrument or doing a showy dance; it is also your effectiveness at being *performative,* such as acting, or flamboyant tricks with a revolver.




#### **Information Skills**

Info skills use your intuition modifier by default. You may pick 2 proficiencies based on your character backstory, and an additional 1 from a list specific to your subclass. Each information skill has a specialization; while you apply proficiency to both specializations of a skill, you pick only one to have expertise in. You can, however, pick the same skill twice for expertise in both specializations.



For example, you are proficient with the Arms skill and have expertise in ballistics; you roll any arms (martial) or arms (ballistics) check with proficiency, but you only apply expertise to arms (ballistics) checks.



##### **Arms**

Arms skill checks pertain to your knowledge of the various armaments of the world, and the applications and characteristics thereof. 



**Specialties**

*Ballistic*: Bows, firearms, anything that hurls a projectile.

*Martial*: Swords, axes, anything that would be deemed a "melee" weapon.



##### **Culture**

Culture skill checks pertain to recalling information about modern society or cultural identities; recognizing a dance that's in or out of style, knowing the fashion trends of a certain people, or identifying the current politics or virtues of a current empire would be culture checks.



**Specialties**

*Arts*: Your knowledge of the arts of a given culture.

*Politics*: Your knowledge of the political landscape in a given culture.


##### **Ecology**

Ecology is your understanding of the ecosystems of the world, the way they function, and the critters who live within them. 



**Specialties**

*Wilderness*: The geology and natural environments of the world.

*Wildlife*: The plants and animals of the world.


##### **History**

History is your knowledge of what's happened to shape the world and its inhabitants as they are today, whether it happened a millennium, century, or decade ago.



**Specialties**

History specializations work a bit differently; you specialize in historical aspects that are specific studies (or of specific relevance) to your character, based on the setting you're in and *its* history.




##### **Mechanics**

Mechanics refers to knowledge of the way *stuff* works, and how to build it; how a car or firearm functions, electronics and appliances, how these items are made, and so on.



**Specialties**


*Fabrication*: How stuff is made e.g. metalworking, carpentry, glassblowing.

*Function*: How stuff works e.g. how your car functions and the parts within it.



##### **Medicine**

Medicine skill checks are things like anatomy, identifying and mending a wound, or afflictions and mental conditions.



**Specialties**

*Illness*: Identifying and treating afflictions, such as a plague or madness.

*Injury*: Identifying and treating injuries, like a broken bone or a concussion.




##### **Survival**

Survival checks are your knowledge of how to survive in a certain environment; how to forage for food and set camp, or find your way around an unfamiliar city.



**Specialties**

*Urban*: How to fend for yourself in settlements, whether it's finding your way, interpreting the local language, or tracking someone through a big crowd.

*Wilderness*: The more traditional understanding of survival; how to  navigate by starlight, track creatures, forage for food, etc.







### RADs & Maneuvers

A **RAD** is when you attempt to do something particularly brilliant or challenging; what distinguishes a RAD from a regular roll or action is the clever or creative nature in which it's executed; a player may be offered the choice to perform an action as a RAD after describing a creative approach to the action, or may request to perform a RAD and explain the details of their approach. 


A RAD will often be an action that is intended to produce multiple effects, and as such may involve multiple rolls in response to it; the only roll that applies the RAD die is the action itself. When following the chain of events the RAD creates, keep in mind that the point of a RAD is not necessarily the bonus to the roll, but to reward a player for smart thinking and good roleplaying. The roll helps of course, but the grander point is to provide a system for which DMs can reward their players for their creativity.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
 
 <font size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **RAD Save DC** </font> = <font size='2'> 8 + (2 x stat modifier from RAD roll) </font>
 
 </center>
 





All RAD dice are d8s, and you have infinite RAD dice. Your minimum RAD die roll is your stat modifier for the RAD.



In combat, you may also attempt to perform RADs as you would outside of combat; however, they have an additional AP cost determined by your DM depending on what you're attempting to do.


#### **Maneuvers**

In combat you have a variety of specific bonuses you may add onto attacks, or as smaller things to do on your turn (or even as reactions), called maneuvers. You may only perform 1 maneuver per turn. 

Maneuvers are primarily acquired through Character Expression Trees. but you may have additional maneuvers given from other sources (such as your subclass or even your weapon). A maneuver is explained where it's given.




### **Disciplines**

Disciplines are a particular way of fighting that someone has trained to become adept at. All characters choose a discipline at level 1. You may choose to change this discipline retroactively, with appropriate in-character coordination with your DM. Warriors may pick an additional discipline at level 5. Rangers pick 2 disciplines on character creation, and may change between them using their core mechanic.

#### **Available Disciplines**



**Careful Aim**

The disadvantage imposed on attacks made in your weapon's far range value is negated.



**Chimaera**

You are able to draw two one-handed weapons simultaneously for the cost of drawing one. When dual wielding, you also gain a new maneuver that does not count against your total maneuvers known, called Follow-through:

**Follow-through**

As part of your attack action, you may make an additional attack with your offhand weapon.



In addition to follow-through, you gain additional benefits if your two drawn weapons are both **light weapons:**

When you attack with one weapon, instead of using follow-through, you may attack with the other drawn weapon simultaneously; the attack and damage rolls must be done simultaneously. Simultaneous attacks cannot have advantage on their rolls, and you cannot attack simultaneously with disadvantage. Additional attacks from follow-through cannot be simultaneous attacks.




**Defensive Blademaster**

When you have a melee weapon drawn, your AC and DT against adjacent attacks is increased by half your FIN mod, rounded up.



**Duelist**

When your only weapon drawn is a one-handed weapon, your free movement is increased by 10ft. and you add +2 to your attack rolls. This bonus does not stack with any bonuses to hit provided on weapons, unless stated otherwise; instead, you pick the higher bonus, and gain an additional benefit: you may reroll any damage dice of a 2 or lower; you must use the new roll. Shotguns do not benefit from this ability; your movespeed is still increased as normal.



**Heavy Hitter**

When rolling damage with a two-handed weapon, you may reroll any damage dice of a 2 or lower; you must use the new roll. Shotguns do not benefit from heavy hitter.





**Reach Weapon**

Your attacking range with two-handed melee weapons is increased by 5ft.



**Consistency**

Your weapons' base ROF penalties are decreased by 1, to a minimum of -2.

Incompatible with Frenzy. *Requires at least a 0 in both PHY and FIN.*



**Track and Trap**

Opportunity attacks made with shotguns are not made with disadvantage.



**Frenzy**

Your weapons with an ROF greater than 1, have their ROF increased by 1.

Incompatible with Consistency.



**Trench Fighter**

Weapons you have drawn are considered one size class smaller. (sizes do not get smaller than compact) 

*Requires proficiency in sleight of hand.*



**Fleet-footed**

Your movespeed is increased by 5 ft., and your dash actions can also go 5ft. farther.



**Mortal Wounds**

Your attacks deal an additional 1d4 damage. Heavy hitter does not affect mortal wounds damage.

## Warrior: Arms

###

**Arms flavor and stuff**

Talk about arms and legs here or whatever



**Proficiencies**

#### Focus & Stances
*Level 1 ability*

When choosing Arms as your subclass, pick one of INT or WIT, and one of PHY or FIN; the first choice is your brains, and the second choice is your brawn. When you roll a natural 8 or higher on any roll that applies the chosen stats (besides damage rolls), you generate 1 focus. When determining turn order, you choose a stance to start the round in. Your cap for focus is 3.



**Stances**

Arms warriors have two stances they may enter in combat; battle stance, or tank stance. Switching stances costs 1 AP, and each alters the options available to you greatly.



###

**Battle Stance**

*Passive: Your movespeed increases to 20ft.*



**Actions:**



**Bladestorm**

You may spend 1 focus to restore your attack action. This action has no AP cost.





###

**Tank Stance**

*Passive: Your AC is increased by 1.*



**Actions:**



**Grit**

Once per turn, as an action, you may restore your Will by a d12 + FOR. If you actually restore Will, you generate 1 focus.



**Tactical Assessment**

Once per turn, for 1 AP, you may target one creature within 75ft. and make a check with your brains stat. (DC = 11 + WIT) On a success, until the start of your next turn, that foe's cover benefits are negated and opportunity attacks against it cannot have disadvantage.

#### Adrenaline
*level 1 ability*

Once per turn, when you are attacked and take damage, you generate 1 focus. If you are in tank stance, you do not have to take damage from the attack; you still generate 1 focus so long as an attack is made against you.



#### Ignore Pain
*Level 2 ability*

As a reaction, you may spend 1 focus to make an attack against you or an ally (who can perceive your encouragements) within 75ft. deal half damage, rounded down. In tank stance, once per long rest, you can use ignore pain to make a lethal hit instead reduce you to 1 Will.

#### Taunt
*Level 2 ability*

Once per turn, as an action in tank stance, you may taunt an enemy (who can perceive your encouragements) within 75ft. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy has disadvantage attacking anybody but you, and cannot use their opportunity attack on anybody but you. Taunting an enemy generates 1 focus.

For 1 snark, you can activate an alternate form of disengage, called *sneaky bastard.* Sneaky bastard lasts until the start of your next turn, and causes all opportunity attacks made against you to have un-negatable disadvantage, and can only damage you if they break your AC - breaking just your DT is still considered a miss. 


#### Cheeky Bastard
*Level 1 ability*

As an action, you may taunt an enemy (if they can perceive the taunt) within 75ft. to attack you (if they can actually attack you); taunted attacks do not count as opportunity attacks, but *do* consume an enemy's opportunity attack if they have one. If a taunted attack would be impeded by cover, the AC and DT bonus is doubled for that attack. If an enemy attacks you and misses, they cannot be taunted again until your next turn - if they hit, you may taunt them again for free; doing so grants you 2 snark.

If you crit you may deal full damage. So long as you at least break DT, they cannot make reactions or opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn. *Regardless* of making a hit, you may move up to 10ft.

When attacking an enemy, even if you miss, they have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make until the start of your next turn.



<!--
### Warrior: Marksman

#### Core Mechanic



### Enhanced Maneuvers

You 

**Keen Aim**

You may use your hastened action to add double your proficiency modifier to the next ranged attack roll you make on this turn, or triple it if you have advantage. If your weapon has the ability to use the Aim action, you may combine the two abilities when activating one of them.

*3rd level ability.*

-->




<!--

## Barbarian

###



<!--

#### AC and DT

Barbarian's base AC is now 14, and its DT is 8. Unarmored defense is removed from Barbarian for balance and thematic reasons - I can try to add this back later in a revised form, but for now I think this is okay.

#### Rage

Rage no longer ends if you do not take or deal damage.





## Fighter

###



<!--

Fighters are *skilled* with firearms.

#### AC and DT

Fighter's base AC is 16, and its DT is 10.

#### Fighting Styles

**Chimaera (Two-Weapon Fighting)**

On top of the base benefits from Two-Weapon Fighting, you gain a new maneuver that does not count against your total maneuvers known, called Follow-through:

**Follow-through**

Once per turn, as part of your attack action, you may make an additional attack with your offhand weapon.

If you have two light weapons drawn, when making your second attack, you may roll your superiority die and add its roll to the damage of that attack.



<!--

In addition to follow-through, you gain additional benefits depending on the weapons your character has drawn.

**Two guns:** 

You may reload both weapons at the same time for the cost of reloading one.

**Two light weapons:**

When you attack with one weapon, you can also attack with your other drawn weapon. However, you cannot use either weapon's ROF attacks when doing this.




<!--

**Dueling**

When taking the Dueling fighting style, you gain 15ft of free movement so long as your only weapon drawn is a one-handed weapon, and you now add a +2 to both your attack and damage rolls. If the only one-handed weapon you have drawn is a melee weapon, you may add your proficiency modifier to its damage rolls as well.



<!--

**Great Weapon Fighting**

Great Weapon Fighting's normal benefits also apply to two-handed ranged weapons. In addition to its standard benefits, you may add your proficiency modifier to your damage rolls when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon.



<!--

**Track and Trap**

Opportunity attacks made with shotguns are not made with disadvantage.



<!--

**Marksmanship (Archery)**

Marksmanship is currently removed until I have a proper replacement.



#### Extra Attack (2)

The attack action nows costs 3 AP instead of 5.

#### Action Surge

At the start of a round, you may use Action Surge to move yourself to the top of initiative order, regardless of your initiative roll. This replaces Action Surge's original function.

### Echo Knight

Your echo can make ranged weapon attacks as well, but they may not benefit from the RoF of a gun. You and your echoes share the ammunition in your weapon, e.g. if you fire your weapon, your echoes also have that ammo consumed, and vice versa.

### Battlemaster

Battlemaster now starts with two additional maneuvers. Your superiority dice upgrade to D10 at 7th level, and D12 at 15th level.


#### Relentless

Relentless is now gained upon choosing the Battlemaster subclass and always restores 3 superiority dice, up to your maximum, regardless of how many superiority dice you have when rolling initiative. Each time you gain an additional superiority die, Relentless also restores an additional die.

At level 18, you restore all your superiority dice when an attack critically strikes. This effect does not apply to additional attacks made granted by a weapon's RoF stat.

#### Inspire (replaces 18th level ability)

At 18th level, you gain one additional maneuver, that doesn't count against your total amount of maneuvers known.

**Inspire**

You may expend one superiority die and inspire your allies, restoring one superiority die to each ally and granting them temporary Will equal to your fighter level.

<!--

### Knight



<!--

#### Implacable Mark

You may also activate Implacable Mark on a successful ranged weapon attack, and the special attacks granted from this ability may also be made with a ranged weapon. You may also activate the special attack when the affected creature moves while within your weapon's range, but the attack does not gain advantage or deal extra damage.

#### Hold the Line

You can also make a Hold the Line attack with a ranged weapon when a creature moves while within your weapon's range. This attack does not gain advantage or deal extra damage, and instead halves that creature's remaining movement speed.

-->

<!--




## Monk

###

Monks are *skilled* with firearms.



<!--

All monk abilities that are based on WIS are now based on ACU.

#### AC and DT

Unarmored defense's base AC value is now 8, and is capped at 16. Unarmored defense also determines your DT, and your base DT value is 4.

Unarmored defense is retained because to me it feels like one of the most integral and thematically relevant pieces of monk as a class, and it gives it an extra unique touch in a system where every other class's AC is static, as well as making ACU an extra interesting and important stat for monk.



<!--

#### Monk Weapons

If you are proficient with firearms, you may choose a firearm (imposing the same restrictions as any other monk weapon) as a monk weapon as well, but its damage is unaltered. The *heavy* property does not exist in my system.

#### Flurry of Blows

Flurry of Blows is compatible with firearms, although it functions with different rules:

You may spend 1 ki point to activate Flurry of Blows, allowing you to make a free attack with your firearm, which does not count towards your attack action limit.

#### Stunning Strike

Stunning Strike may additionally be used as a reaction on an enemy who attempts to make a melee attack against you. First, they roll to hit as normal. Then, you roll an unarmed melee attack with proficiency; treat their roll as the AC for yours to beat. If your attack hits, they are stunned as normal and you take no damage, and your reaction and ki point are consumed. If you miss, their attack hits as normal; your ki point is not consumed, but your reaction is.

### Kensei



<!--

#### Artist's Precision
(optionally replaces Kensei's Shot)

You may spend 1 ki point to precisely target your attacks, adding a roll of your martial arts die to each attack roll for that turn. Extra shots fired via a gun's rate of fire do not benefit from this ability.

### Long Death



<!--

#### Touch of Death

Touch of Death is activated any time you reduce a creature to 0Will, regardless of distance from it.

#### Touch of the Long Death

You may apply Touch of the Long Death to a ranged attack if it hits. The creature must still roll a Fortitude save and take damage accordingly.



### Mercy (UA: 2020 Subclasses)



<!--

#### Hands of Healing

You may also activate Hands of Healing with ranged attacks. You must still roll to hit, and you still consume ammo when firing to activate this ability. Instead of dealing damage, you heal as normal with Hands of Healing.

Yes, this is stupid, but it's cooler than it is stupid.

#### Hands of Harm

You may also activate Hands of Harm with ranged attacks.

#### Noxious Aura

Instead of creating an Aura, you may instead spend 1 ki point and apply its effects to a creature struck by a ranged attack you make for 18 seconds. The Aura, and all its standard effects, apply to the injured creature, and emanate from it as well. Creatures under the effect of the Aura in this manner have disadvantage on ranged attacks until it ends, and it may be dismissed by you under normal means.

#### Hand of Mercy

You may activate Hand of Mercy with a successful ranged attack on a creature. All other rules still apply.




<!--

## Paladin



<!--

### Smites

Smites may also be activated on successful ranged weapon attacks.

### Ancients



<!--

#### Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath

You may also use your Nature's Wrath on a creature that you've successfully injured with a ranged attack regardless of distance from it, up to 10 minutes after successfully dealing damage.

#### Elder Champion

The distance of which you impose disadvantages with this ability is 50 feet.

### Conquest



<!--

#### Invincible Conqueror

All your weapon attacks crit on a 19 or 20 on the d20.

### Oathbreaker



<!--

#### Aura of Hate

Your Aura of Hate applies to all weapon attacks by all normally affected creatures within range.

#### Dread Lord

You may use your hastened action to apply 3d10 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage to a single successful ranged weapon attack on your turn.

### Treachery (UA: Paladin)



<!--

#### Aura of Treachery

**Cull the Herd:** The benefits this ability applies to melee attacks are also applied to ranged weapon attacks.

**Treacherous Strikes:** The range of this ability is equal to 5ft x your Paladin level and may also be applied to ranged attacks made against you; you may make the target make a ranged attack within their weapon's range, provided they have ammunition for it.

### Vengeance



<!--

#### Vow of Enmity

The range of this ability is limited to any creature you can see.

Additionally, from Soul of Vengeance, you may use your reaction to make any weapon attack against that creature.




-->

<!--

## Ranger (Revised)



<!--

On creation, all Rangers may take firearms proficiency for free if it suits the character; this is entirely a thematic choice considering a Ranger's place in the frontier.

### Horizon Walker



<!--

#### Planar Warrior

You may also use Planar Warrior on a creature that you've successfully injured with a ranged attack regardless of distance from it, up to 10 minutes after successfully dealing damage.

### Hunter



<!--

#### Hunter's Prey: Giant Killer

The range of your Giant Killer ability is equal to 10ft x your Ranger level.

#### Multiattack: Volley

You may only make a single attack against each creature within Volley's range, regardless of your weapon's RoF. Your Volley attack ends when you have to reload your weapon.



-->

<!--

## Rogue

###

Rogues are *skilled* with firearms.

#### AC and DT

Rogue's base AC is 13, and its DT is 10.




## Bard

###

Bards are *skilled* with firearms.

Bardic Inspiration dice are now called Soul Charges, which represent the power of your performances to empower the souls of those who hear it. 

You have a number of charges equal to your proficiency modifier + your CHA modifier; your charges replenish on a long rest, or on any roll of a natural 18 or higher that applies your CHA mod. On a short rest you restore a number equal to your CHA modifier.

#### AC and DT

Bard's base AC is 13, and its DT is 9.

#### Song of Inspiration

*Song of Inspiration is just Bardic Inspiration renamed.*

Song of Inspiration's range is increased to 100ft, and now lasts an hour until consumed. Song of Inspiration consumes a Soul Charge to use, but not a hastened action.

#### Song of Vitality

Your art stokes the wellbeing of the soul itself, soothing those who hear it. As a hastened action, you may consume a Soul Charge and make a revitalizing performance; all creatures you choose who can hear (including yourself) within 100ft may restore an amount of Will equal to your Bard level + a roll of your Soul Charge die - you roll the die once, and all creatures are restored that amount.

You may also perform a Song of Vitality without consuming a Soul Charge when you take a short rest. Song of Vitality is enhanced at level 13.

*Song of Vitality replaces Song of Rest. Level 2 ability.*

#### Guile

Your soul's connection to your artistic ability pervades everything you do, allowing you to imbue normal actions with your artistic prowess.

When you make a roll that does not use your CHA modifier, you may spend 1 AP to add half your CHA modifier (rounded up) to the roll. Rolls using Guile may not restore Soul Charges.

*Guile replaces Jack of all Trades. Level 2 ability.*

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at level 5, you may now make 2 attack actions per round.

*Extra Attack replaces Font of Inspiration.*

#### Song of Conviction

Your art is a conduit of the living soul's desire to persevere in the face of adversity. As a hastened action, you may consume a Soul Charge and make a performance to bolster the spirit of one comrade within 100ft who can hear you; for the next hour, they have a charge of Conviction, which may be consumed at any time to add your proficiency modifier + your CHA mod to one roll they make, before they hear the results of the roll.

*Song of Conviction replaces Countercharm, and is instead granted at level 7.*



#### Song of Swiftness

As your connection between art and soul strengthens, you can grant the soul an uncanny burst of speed with an invigorating performance. 

On your turn you may consume your hastened action and a Soul Charge to perform a Song of Swiftness, granting one ally within 100ft who can hear you 7 additional AP to use this round - this AP does not carry into the next round, but can still be applied to next round's initiative. 

*Song of Swiftness replaces Song of Rest (d8). Level 9 ability.*

#### Bard College feature (level 10)

*This subclass feature replaces Magical Secrets.*

#### Extra Attack (2)

At 11th level, you may now make the attack action 3 times per round. Your attack action now only costs 3 AP.

#### Greater Song of Vitality

The deep bond between art and soul allows you to make a soul-cleansing performance, wiping away ailments of yourself and your allies. You may now perform Song of Vitality as a reaction, and in addition to its normal effects, it also clears one negative status condition of those who are healed by it.

*Greater Song of Vitality replaces Song of Rest (d10). Level 13 ability.*

#### Beguiling

Starting at level 15, you may now restore a Soul Charge on rolls that use Guile.

#### Haste

Connecting your artistic strength to your soul hastens your physical speed. You now start with two hastened actions each round - restoring a hastened action still only restores one, and you may not have more than two hastened actions stored at a time.

*Haste replaces Song of Rest (d12). Level 17 ability.*

#### Bard College feature (level 18)

*This subclass feature replaces Magical Secrets.*

#### Soul of the Performer

Your soul's bond with your art is now perfected, and the power of your performer's soul is channeled through your body with every breath you take. You restore all your Soul Charges on a short or long rest, and each time a roll would restore a Soul Charge, it instead restores two.

*Soul of the Performer replaces Superior Inspiration. Level 20 ability.*
 




<!--

## Warlock



<!--

### Pact of the Blade

If your character is in possession of a firearm when choosing this pact, you may select that firearm as your pact weapon instead. A dismissed firearm's capacity is unchanged when it is dismissed or summoned. You may change this to a different firearm on a long rest.

### Hexblade (what a surprise)



<!--

#### Hex Warrior

Your "hexblade" can also be two-handed, and you may select a ranged weapon.

## Old System Subclasses Kept for Reference



### Fighter: Sharpshooter

The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter dedicates themselves to the impeccable placement of each attack, managing distance and keeping the upper hand to turn a situation to their advantage. When you choose this martial archetype, you gain proficiency with firearms if you do not already have it.

### Keen Eye

Your skill and precision allows you to take exceptional care in your attacks, and you possess a remarkable eye for detail. 

When you choose this archetype, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill, or expertise if you are already proficient. In addition, you gain the following ability: 

**Keen Aim**

You may use your hastened action to add double your proficiency modifier to the next ranged attack roll you make on this turn, or triple it if you have advantage. If your weapon has the ability to use the Aim action, you may combine the two abilities when activating one of them.

*3rd level ability.*

### Scrutiny

Patience, preparedness, and awareness are key to the perfect strike. You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill if you do not already have it, or expertise if you are already proficient. You also gain the following ability:

**Careful Watch**

You have a number of Careful Watch charges equal to your proficiency modifier. When making an opportunity attack, you may spend a charge of Careful Watch to grant advantage to that attack. Your charges of Careful Watch are replenished after a short rest.

*7th level ability.*

### Unerring Awareness

Your senses have become sharpened to a needletip, and your attention to your environment is unwavering. You can no longer have disadvantage on any Perception or Investigation checks, and you can no longer be surprised. Additionally, the range values of your ranged weapons are now doubled.

*10th level ability.*



### Snipe

You have mastered the ability to place a single, perfect shot. Once per short rest, you may choose one attack roll you make and make it an automatic critical hit.

*15th level ability.*

### Infallible Senses

You have become so attuned and alert to the world around you that you can subvert magical phenomena. You gain truesight out to 50ft.

*18th level ability.*



### Fighter: Quickdraw

A quickdraw fighter emphasizes speed and spectacular reflexes in combat; they move and act quickly, using their incredible speed to outpace their quarries. When you choose this martial archetype, you gain proficiency with firearms if you do not already have it.

### Slick

Your natural agility begins to manifest, letting you move and perform administrative actions much faster.

Your movespeed increases by 15ft, and you only spend half your movespeed to stand up from being prone. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your movespeed. 

Additionally, you may draw and stow one-handed weapons at will without consuming an action. When drawing one-handed weapons, you can do so faster than most creatures can react, and have advantage on any rolls to do so without detection.

*3rd level ability.*

### Sleight of Hand 

Weapon handling and rapid, clean motions have become second nature to you. You gain expertise with Sleight of Hand, and have advantage on any performance checks that involve using or brandishing a firearm.

Reloading single loading weapons now only costs 1 AP per 2 rounds loaded on that turn. Packet loading weapons no longer cost a hastened action to reload, and instead always cost only 1 AP.

Your quick fingers also have other, less scrupulous applications; you gain expertise with the dice and playing card gaming sets, and you have advantage on any skill checks made related to the physical use of these sets.

*7th level ability.*

### Slicker 

You continue to get lighter on your feet; you gain an additional 15ft of movement, and may take the dash or disengage actions as hastened actions.

*10th level ability.*

### Adrenaline

Your wicked sharp reflexes allow you to make short bursts of immediate, reactionary movement. 

When you're about to make a roll that applies your FIN modifier, you may choose to make this roll with advantage; you may not use Adrenaline after you have made your initial roll. You may use Adrenaline a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per long rest.

*15th level ability.*



### Slickest

Your agility is unparalleled, bordering on supernatural; you are permanently under the effects of the Freedom of Movement spell.

*18th level ability.*

### Redo

Sometimes, going too fast can create mistakes you wouldn't otherwise have made; fortunately, your incredible speed lets you compensate for them. 

Once per turn, after you make a roll that applies your FIN modifier, you may choose to reroll it; this reroll has none of the negative modifiers (such as disadvantage or flat reductions) the roll originally had, and you must use the new result. Adrenaline can be activated on your new roll. You may use Redo a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per long rest.

*18th level ability.*




### Rogue: Snubnose

Snubnose rogues fashion their name after compact revolvers of the same name; they rely on getting up against a foe, blasting them into pieces, and slinking away til they can surprise another target to overwhelm yet again.

When you choose this archetype, you gain proficiency with firearms if you didn't already have it.

### Point Blank

Your approach to using firearms seeks to remove the possibility to ever miss in the first place, instead closing the gap and gunning them down in close quarters.

You can draw and stow a one-handed firearm as free action, and you may treat all one-handed weapons as compact. Instead, you are granted advantage on ranged weapon attacks made within 5 feet of the target. After making a successful point blank attack against that creature, it may not make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.

*3rd level ability.*

### Barrel Stuffing

The immediate proximity to your target allows you to make even more intense, brutal attacks. When you make a point blank attack, you gain advantage on the attack regardless of any other modifiers that would normally impose disadvantage on your attack, and you halve the shot penalty of your weapon for that action, rounded up.

*9th level ability.*

### Brandish

A weapon flashed at the right moment could be the perfect catalyst to change an adversary's mind, and you have mastered this art. You gain advantage on Intimidation checks made using a weapon, and you gain the Brandish ability.

**Brandish**

As a hastened action in combat, you may attempt to intimidate a foe into submission. Choose one target within 30 feet that can see or hear you, and roll an Intimidation check against that creature. If you succeed, they become *frightened* of you and their movespeed is halved until the end of their next turn. After Brandish's effects wear off on a creature, it cannot be intimidated by Brandish again for 30 seconds.

*9th level ability.*



### Agility

Your agile nature lets you carry your momentum from attacking into quick bursts of movement. Immediately after making a successful attack (including attacks of opportunity), you gain 15ft. of movement which may be only used directly after the attack. After using movement from Agility, you may not use it again until the start of your next turn.

*13th level ability.*



### Ghostwalk

You have refined your movement to perfection, able to weave in and out of the sights of foes without a second thought. Disengage no longer consumes a hastened action, and instead always costs just 1 AP.

*17th level ability.*

  **Bipod:** As an action, you may mount your bipod on either the ground or other surfaces such as short walls and ledges. Dismounting your bipod is also an action. Mounting your bipod on the ground forces you to drop to prone. Firing from a bipod does not impose disadvantage when prone, and halves your shot penalty, rounded down, to a minimum of -1. While your bipod is mounted, you may take the **Steady Aim** action.  

  **Steady Aim:** You may end any further movement for your current turn to grant advantage on the next shot you fire with this weapon on your turn.
